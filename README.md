# Exploring the Efficacy of Evolutionary Algorithms in Image Recovery

This project explores the use of **evolutionary algorithms** for enhancing and reconstructing images. By leveraging evolutionary techniques, we aim to improve image quality and clarity from noisy or incomplete inputs. This approach combines principles of natural evolution with computational methods to tackle complex image processing tasks.
